# Customer Funnel Analysis

This project explores **Customer Funnel Drop-Off Analysis** to understand user behavior across different stages of a sales or product journey — from awareness to purchase.

## 📊 Objective

To identify user drop-off points in a typical customer journey and analyze stage-wise conversion using **SQL** and **Power BI**, providing insights to improve user acquisition, engagement, and retention.

## 🧠 What is Funnel Analysis?

Customer Funnel Analysis is a strategic method to track how users move through stages like:

- Awareness  
- Interest  
- Consideration  
- Intent  
- Evaluation  
- Purchase  

By analyzing conversion rates between stages, businesses can pinpoint bottlenecks, improve UX, and drive better outcomes.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **SQL**: For querying and analyzing funnel data  
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard creation  
- **Python** *(optional)*: For preprocessing or extending analysis  
- **Mock Data**: Simulated data of ~5000 users across 6 funnel stages  

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Created a mock dataset to simulate user flow through funnel stages
- Used SQL to compute stage-wise conversion rates and drop-offs
- Built interactive Power BI dashboards to visualize insights
- Identified key bottlenecks and suggested improvements based on data
